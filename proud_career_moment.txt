My team was tasked with onboarding a new MacOS version for use to support the latest IPhone for our customers to test on. This involved a mostly automated process via ansible and some custom python scripts on roughly 400 mac minis in datacenters across the world. I was tasked with refactoring these ansible playbooks and scripts where possible and to make them more time efficient while also building the new ansible playbook for the installation of the new MacOS version. I am proud of this specific task as this was a complex task that required quite a lot of planning and research as I was new to creating ansible playbooks and needed to learn a lot in a short space of time. I also know that the refactored playbooks and installation playbook are still being used inside the company to date and the same playbooks have been slightly tweaked to accommodate the new versions so the changes I made and playbooks I created have given quite a lot of value to the teams using them.
